Frontend Developer at Aruba coding challenge Outline:

We want to host an event and invite all of our customers who are located within a certain distance from the venue to attend. In order to do this, we would like you to create a website that displays a list of people on a map and can filter these people by their distance relative to an arbitrary pair of GPS coordinates.

Language

Any language you are comfortable with, however, bonus if it’s in React or implemented as a SPA.
