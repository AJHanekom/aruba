Frontend Developer at Aruba coding challenge Outline:

We want to host an event and invite all of our customers who are located within a certain distance from the venue to attend. In order to do this, we would like you to create a website that displays a list of people on a map and can filter these people by their distance relative to an arbitrary pair of GPS coordinates.
